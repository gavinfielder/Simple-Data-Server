# Simple Data Server

This web app handles a persistent data source which stores an ID, a floating-point value, and a timestamp. I am building this as an educational tool to learn ASP.NET, SQL Server, and possibly WCF.

It is currently deployed on AWS. The latest deployment can be seen [here](rgftestdeploy.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com).
