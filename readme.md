# Simple Data Server

This web app handles a persistent data source which stores an ID, a floating-point value, and a timestamp. 

I am building this as an educational tool. My learning goals for this project are:
 - ASP.Net
 - WCF
 - SQL Server (coming soon)
 - Deployment on AWS using EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS toolkit for Visual Studio


## Current Deployment
It is currently deployed on AWS. The latest deployment can be seen [here](http://rgftestdeploy.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
